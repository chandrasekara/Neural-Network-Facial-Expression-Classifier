A collection of projects completed as part of the coursework for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. 

The 'guided' folder contains a collection of projects that were completed by using skeleton code provided by Udacity. This code often simplified the process of completing tasks such as importing of data, pre-processing and evaluation. I completed sections of the code as prescribed by Udacity, to build knowledge of machine learning tools in a particular area. These areas include, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. These projects were built in Python 2.

The 'capstone' folder contains a project completed completely from scratch by myself, and was completed to demonstrate the level of machine learning skill I had developed throughout the course. This project was built using Python 3. The capstone project is a **Facial Expressions Classifier**, in which I utilized deep learning techniques to build a classifier that can identify different facial expressions in an human of a human face.

Jupyter Notebooks are used extensively for organization and display of Python code. In order to view these, use: `jupyter notebook NOTEBOOKNAME.ipynb`
