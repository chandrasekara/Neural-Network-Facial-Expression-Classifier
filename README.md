A collection of projects completed as part of the coursework for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. 

These projects were completed to reinforce knowledge in the following areas: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning

Descriptions of each of the projects, for each section, are detailed below:

**Supervised Learning - Predicition of Housing Prices in Boston**
	
-Utilized historical housing data from Boston to predict prices of unknown houses<br>
-Made use of linear regression to draw relationships between house and neighbourhood characteristics

**Unsupervised Learning - Identifying Customer Segments for a Wholesale Distributor**
	
-Used clustering algorithms to split the large dataset into different segments, corresponding to different customer types<br>
-Investigated use of Principal Component Analysis to aid with performance of clustering algorithms and for visualization purposes

**Reinforcement Learning - Training a Self Driving Car in a Simulation**

-Investigated use of Q-learning to train a smartcab to drive safely and optimally in a simulation

**Deep Learning - Dog Breed Classifier**

-Utilized convolutional neural networks to recognize different dog breeds in images<br>
-Investigated the performance of many different architectures in Keras, using GPU acceleration to speed up training time<br>
-Utilized transfer learning by making use of pre-trained networks, such as the VGG16 and Resnet-50 models
