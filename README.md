A collection of projects completed as part of the coursework for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. 

The 'guided' folder contains a collection of projects that were completed by using skeleton code provided by Udacity. This code often simplified the process of completing tasks such as importing of data, pre-processing and evaluation. I completed sections of the code as prescribed by Udacity, to build knowledge of machine learning tools in a particular area. These areas include, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. These projects were built in Python 2.

The 'capstone' folder contains a project completed completely from scratch by myself, and was completed to demonstrate the level of machine learning skill I had developed throughout the course. This project was built using Python 3.

The majority of code for each of the projects exists within Jupyter notebooks. In order to run the code, Jupyter must first be installed. This can be done by [installing Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (recommended) or through pip by using: `pip3 install jupyter`
