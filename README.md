A collection of projects completed as part of the coursework for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree by Udacity in collaboration with Kaggle.

The 'capstone' folder contains a project completed from scratch in Python 3, and was completed to demonstrate the level of machine learning skill I had developed throughout the course. The capstone project is a **Facial Expressions Classifier**, in which I utilized deep learning techniques to classify different facial expressions in an image of a human face. The procedure and results of the project were documented in a report, located in the same folder.

The 'guided' folder contains a collection of projects that were completed by using skeleton code provided by the course instructors. This code often simplified the process of completing tasks such as importing of data, pre-processing and evaluation. I completed sections of the code as prescribed, to build knowledge of machine learning tools in a particular area. These areas include, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. These projects were developed using Python 2.

Jupyter Notebooks are used extensively for organization and display of Python code. In order to view these, use:
`jupyter notebook NOTEBOOKNAME.ipynb`
