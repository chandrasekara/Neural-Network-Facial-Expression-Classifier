    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Naive Bayes\n",
    "    -Naive Bayes is quite extensively used in spam filters for email.\n",
    "    -Naive does relatively well in a variety of applications, it is generally used as a classifier first, before any others, as it is very simple to implement, and provides a baseline to be used for comparing other classifiers.\n",
    "    -Naive Bayes is naive in the sense it assumes that all features are independent of each other. Therefore, if there are some strong correlations between features (which there usually is), this can potentially compromise the performance of Naive Bayes\n",
    "    -Naive Bayes will be a good candidate for the problem by providing a baseline for which other classifiers can be compared to\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Decision Trees\n",
    "    -The medical field has long used decision trees, particularly for the area of diagnoses. Given that a particular disease would have a given number of physical symptoms or manifestations associated with it, decision trees would work by picking out these features that lead to a certain outcome.\n",
    "    -Decision Trees are very easily able to work with both categorical and continuous data, which is the case for our dataset. Generally, it  works well when there aren't too many features in the dataset being analysed. It's also able to handle large datasets without excessive computation time\n",
    "    -Decision Trees tend to overfit, and therefore underperform, when there is a high amount of features in the dataset. \n",
    "    -It is one of the few classifiers that is proven to work well with a mixture of continuous and categorical data, as well as the fact there isn't too many features in the dataset and so would be expected to perform quite well.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. K-Nearest Neighbours\n",
    "    -Many credit card companies utilize K-nearest-neighbours to analyse transactions, to attempt to predict which are fraudulent. By comparing the features of different transactions, K-nearest-neighbours can show whether a particular transaction is an outlier with respect to previous transactions.\n",
    "    -K-NN works well when feature values that are close in magnitude are generally similar. Given a sufficiently large value of K, it is relatively tolerant of noise in datasets.\n",
    "    -K-NN, like many other algorithms, makes the assumption that all features matter equally. This can prove to be an issue when, for a particular dataset, one feature influences the label a lot more than others. \n",
    "    -Despite the fact that K-NN isn't usually used with categorical data, it may prove useful for this dataset since we have normalized each of the continuous variables to a value between 0 and 1, and so this may potentially allow for the category variables, which will either have a value of 0 or 1, to be used with the continuous variables."

    "**Answer: ** The model that has the highest F score and accuracy score for each subset of the training data is overwhelmingly the Decision Tree Classifier, with scores at or near 1.0 for each data subset. However, comparing this to the performance on the testing set, we see a big reduction in score, down to around a 0.6 F score for use of 100% of the training data. This suggests that the Decision Tree Classifier has fit the training data quite well, although cannot generalize to unseen data as well. In comparison, the K Nearest Neighbours classifier performed worse when assessed with the training data, however outperformed the Decision Tree Classifier on the testing set, for each subset of training data used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the performance on the testing data is what is more important, this seems to imply that K Nearest Neighbours would be the ideal classification algorithm to use. However, something to consider is that this classifier took siginificantly longer to return predictions to data. For prediction using 100% of the training set, the K Nearest Neighbours classifier took over 25 seconds. This may prove troublesome if we want to run Cross Validation to see which parameters for the K Nearest Neighbours Classifier are best, or if we need to run the prediction many times on many datasets. It also took longer to train, although the difference was not as pronounced, taking about 1 second as compared to around 0.4 seconds for the Decision Tree Classifier. When looking at the performances of each of the classifiers for use of 100% of the training set, it can be seen that KNN only marginally outperforms Decision Trees, in both the accuracy and F score metrics. Both classifiers have an F score of around 0.6 for 100% use of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, it seems that the better choice of classifier is the Decision Tree. This has been selected due to the likelihood that Cross Validation or multiple runs will be required, which will prove quite tedious if KNN is used. Also, given the dataset and how it has quite a few features, the prediction time will only get worse as the dataset size is increased."

I would put Occcupation after hours per week, as the occupation would generally be a good indication of the hourly rate someone is paid, therefore another key insight into a person's yearly wage. I would put age after this, just based on the assumption that the longer people have been working, the more skilled they would generally be, and therefore would attract a higher wage. I listed Capital Gain after this, based on the logic that the more income someone has, the more money in total they would have left over after living expenses to invest. More money invested would generally mean higher capital gains, which would imply someone is more likely to be earning in excess of \\$50,000. Lastly I put education level, as I believed that every level of tertiary qualification would bring with it, it's own set of skills, therefore attracting more pay and making someone more likely to earn in excess of \\$50k"

    "**Answer:** For the most part, the features found to be the most important are the same or are quite similar to those discussed earlier. What was interesting was that capital loss was also a significant factor, which makes sense given that the more money is invested, the greater the potential for losses, as well as gains. It follows that capital losses are actually a greater indicator of higher income than capital gains, as it's expected that most assets depreciate in value, therefore higher income households would be quite likely to have incurred capital losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was interesting to see that education-num was the feature that was found to be important, rather than education_level. This makes sense as having a number distinguish between the levels of education would allow for more information to be ascertained, with respect to how much skills a person has. For example, having education-num for a HS grad as 9, 13 for a Bachelor's degree and 14 for a Masters degree, encapsulates the fact that a Bachelors degree is a much higher qualification than a HS diploma, however the change in magnitude of qualification going from Bachelors to Masters degree isn't as great. This is likely why this feature was found to be more important, as compared to education_level, which was simply a categorical variable."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

As well the reduction in F score was only about 6%. This shows how paying attention to features that are more important can substantially reduce the amount of data required to achieve a certain performance. \n",

    "Training time was definitely a factor in choosing the final model, in fact it is precisely why I chose Decision Trees instead of KNN. If we needed to limit training time, using the reduced dataset could be an option. With this reduced dataset however, it may end up being more economical to change the algorithm being used for the classifier, from Decision Trees to KNN, or even Support Vector Machines, which was considered to be one of the classifiers used however was disregarded due to the extremely high amount of time it took to train. Therefore, using the reduced dataset is definitely a viable option in the case that training time was limited."
