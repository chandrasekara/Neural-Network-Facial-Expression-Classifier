**Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone Project**

The dataset used for this project can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge

Run the program through the Jupyter notebook using:
`jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb`

Alternatively, the Python (v3) code can be run on it's own using:
`python analysis.py`

Several minor functions used in the analayis code are defined in the utility_functions.py file
